/**
 * Simulates sync node and measuring node prediction and sending data for a given data set
 * Can use different prediction algorithms like moving average, linear predictor
 * Can sumulate one dimensional and two dimensional data 
 * Threshold for prediction vs sending real data is set manually
 *
 * Returns the number of sent and predicted measurements and the average error of predicted data
 * for every given threshold and  prediction algorithm
